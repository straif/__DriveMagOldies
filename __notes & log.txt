TODO:
- the big logo verbessern
- flex-slider: isolate the cars from their backgrounds + adaptare imagine/text explicativ dreapta
- left col icons - make a set of collection car icons & put it on
- implement Search by car under logos ... click AUDI ---> Audi page (implem. with AngularJS!) ... templates>brands
- reorganizat fisierele (css-urile in dir. lor) si rescris path-urile lor ... logo-urile la fel (images>icons) ...

Done
! angular routing pe logo left-column merge DOAR cu "click dreapta>open lnk in new page"
(same situation - only, I isolated the code responsible for that and resolved the issue by using local jQuery. However, when trying to do this on the main project the logo disappears! 
So, there's stuff to understand in the JS files ... Stuff that makes the logo appear on page loading.)
